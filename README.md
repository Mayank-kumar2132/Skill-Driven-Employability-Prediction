# Skill-Driven-Employability-Prediction
### Abstract
Employability prediction is a crucial task in todayâ€™s dynamic job market, aiding in efficient resource allocation and career planning. This project explores the application of both traditional machine learning and advanced deep learning techniques to predict the employability of individuals based on their academic qualifications, skill sets, and relevant experience.

Leveraging a comprehensive dataset comprising diverse attributes of candidates, we employ feature engineering to extract meaningful insights and construct predictive models. This study compares the performance of various machine learning algorithms, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Additionally, we employ deep learning architectures such as:

Feedforward Neural Networks
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Through rigorous experimentation and cross-validation, we demonstrate the superior predictive accuracy of deep learning models in capturing complex patterns within the data. This research contributes to the advancement of predictive analytics in human resources management and offers valuable implications for recruitment processes and career counseling services.
